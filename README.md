# ARENA-Case-Study
Case study used in the Software Engineering textbook by Bernd Bruegge & Allen H. Dutoit, posted here because all links are broken.

Recovered from: https://wwwbruegge.in.tum.de/lehrstuhl_1/images/projects/oose/examples/arena/

Seemingly related website with documentation: https://wwwbruegge.in.tum.de/arena02/

This is an exact duplicate, with no editing. This README file is the only addition.
I am currently unsure about how to get it running, but if I do, it will be in a different branch.
