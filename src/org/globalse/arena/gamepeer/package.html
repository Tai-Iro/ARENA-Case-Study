<P>
This package contains the classes for starting and running game peers. A game peer is a
remote object providing the arena server with access to additional computing
resources for running matches.
</P>
<P>An operator adds a game peer to an arena by
starting a game peer on the host whose resources should be made available (see {@link
org.globalse.arena.gamepeer.StartGamePeer StartGamePeer}). The hostname, port, and
operator password of the arena server are
specified in a properties file. Once successful registration
of the game peer, the arena server requests the creation of new matches from
the game peer when planning new rounds.
</P>

<P>On the arena server, the {@link org.globalse.arena.server.GamePeerManager} class
is responsible for tracking game peers and allocating matches to game peers.
