<P>
This package contains a sample game implementation. Minimally, a game needs
to provide the following classes:

<UL>
<LI>A concrete implementation of the {@link org.globalse.arena.server.Game Game} interface (TicTacToe). This class
defines basic properties of the game, such as the number of players per match, and
acts as a concrete factory for creating {@link org.globalse.arena.server.Match Matches} and Statistics.</LI>
<LI>A concrete implementation of the Match class (TicTacToeMatch). This class
tracks the progress of a match, receives game moves, and broadcasts notification events to
connected players and specators. The TicTacToeMatch class relies heavily on its super class
for most of these tasks and focuses mostly on the tic tac toe specifics.</LI>
<LI>A match panel for viewing matches (TicTacToeMatchPanel). This class is loaded in the
match front end and interacts with the TicTacToeMatch with the Match.playMove method.</LI>
<LI>A mathc panel factory for creating match panels.</LI>
</UL>

When using the arena play move method for communicating between the match panel and the match
classes, the game should also provide a concrete implementation of {@link org.globalse.arena.remote.Move}.</UL>
