<P>
This package contains the game-independent classes of the match front end. The match front
end is a swing client, run either as a standalone application or with java web start,
providing access to the player and spectator to matches in progress. A match front end is
started using the {@link org.globalse.arena.matchfrontend.MatchFrontEnd MatchFrontEnd} class.
</P>
<P>
The match front end relies on {$link org.globalse.arena.matchfrontend.MatchPanelFactory MatchPanelFactories}
registered with the arena server for creating game-specific match panels. The game-specific classes
must be either available in the class path or from a codebase.
</P>

<P>For example of a game-specific match panel, see {@link org.globalse.arena.ttt.TicTacToeMatchPanel}.
